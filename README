# GroupMe ML/NLP Libraries

I intend to use the libraries here to do some MLP/Machine Learning analysis given a corpus of GroupMe messages.

Right now, I'm still working on the GroupMe utility library to hit their API and get the messages.

In order to use the functions in groupme_utils, you need to configure a .env file with your GroupMe token. See
.env.example.

To get your access token, follow the directions [here](https://dev.groupme.com). You'll be able to sign into your
account with your regular GroupMe credentials. Once you get your access token, place it in your personal .env file as shown in the example.
